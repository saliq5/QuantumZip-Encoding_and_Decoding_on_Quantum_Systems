Quantum systems hold immense potential for revolutionizing information processing and communication. Efficient data encoding and decoding techniques play a
crucial role in harnessing the power of quantum systems. In this work, I present approaches for data encoding and decoding in quantum systems that aim to optimize efficiency and enhance the reliability of quantum information transmission. Classical to Quantum data encoding presents a primary hurdle, as it requires specialized
circuits for quantum state initialization. We present decoherence-optimized circuits
for Classical to Quantum Encoding using the Flexible Representation of Quantum
Images (FRQI) method. For Quantum to Classical Decoding, we utilize the Quantum Wavelet Transform particularly the Quantum Haar Transform through one-stage
parallel and pyramidal QHT circuits for more efficient sampling of the output states. <br />

To address the C2Q
data encoding challenge, i utilised the Flexible Representation of
Quantum Images (FRQI) encoding scheme. This approach provides an efficient and
robust method for encoding classical data into quantum states, optimizing the delicate balance between fidelity and circuit complexity. By leveraging FRQI, I achieve
the design of encoding circuits that are optimized for decoherence while remaining
compatible with the constraints of NISQ devices.
In order to address the challenge of quantum-to-classical (Q2C) data decoding, we
used an innovative approach based on the One-Stage Pyramidal Parallel Quantum
Haar Transform (OSPP-QHT). The OSPP-QHT method capitalizes on the inherent
properties of the quantum Haar transform to efficiently sample the output state,
utilizing the parallelism and hierarchical structure of the pyramidal Haar transform.
This approach allows us to minimize the number of measurements needed for precise
decoding, resulting in a significant reduction in overhead and, consequently, improving
the overall execution time efficiency of NISQ devices. For confidentiality purposes i cannot upload the entire code her, so mail me at saliqgowhar7@gmail.com
