Quantum systems hold immense potential for revolutionizing information processing and communication. Efficient data encoding and decoding techniques play a
crucial role in harnessing the power of quantum systems. In this paper, we present
novel approaches for data encoding and decoding in quantum systems that aim to optimize efficiency and enhance the reliability of quantum information transmission. Classical to Quantum data encoding presents a primary hurdle, as it requires specialized
circuits for quantum state initialization. We present decoherence-optimized circuits
for Classical to Quantum Encoding using the Flexible Representation of Quantum
Images (FRQI) method. For Quantum to Classical Decoding, we utilize the Quantum Wavelet Transform particularly the Quantum Haar Transform through one-stage
parallel and pyramidal QHT circuits for more efficient sampling of the output stat
